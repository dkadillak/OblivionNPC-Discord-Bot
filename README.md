# OblivionNPC-Discord-Bot
Making a discord bot that comes into your voice channel and will recite oblivion npc dialogue of your choice

## Current Progress
* bot responds to '>text' which writes a hardcoded npc dialogue line in the `bot-commands` channel
* bot responds to '>speak' which joins your current voice channel, recites an npc dialogue line, and leaves the voice channel

##Demo of '>speak' command
